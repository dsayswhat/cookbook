# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Home cooks need a centralized system to store recipes from multiple sources (websites, books, handwritten notes) in a format that's both human-readable and machine-processable. Existing solutions often lock data in proprietary formats or don't provide adequate organization and export capabilities.

## User Needs
1. **Capture**: Easily input recipes from various sources with full metadata
2. **Organize**: Find recipes by multiple criteria (cuisine, course, dietary needs, ingredients)
3. **Access**: View recipes on any device in the kitchen
4. **Share**: Generate PDFs for printing or sharing with others
5. **Preserve**: Maintain attribution and source information

## Product Goals
- Create a personal recipe database that grows over time
- Provide instant access to any recipe during cooking
- Enable sharing of formatted recipes with friends/family
- Support meal planning through effective categorization
- Preserve the source and history of each recipe

## User Experience Principles
- Recipes should load instantly
- Search should be fast and flexible
- Mobile-friendly for kitchen use
- Print/PDF output should be well-formatted
- Navigation should support browsing by multiple taxonomies
