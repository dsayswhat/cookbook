- Need to standardize recipe metadata structure
- Should establish a deployment validation process
- Need to document the CSS styling approach and class naming conventions

## Known Issues
- PDF generation approach needs testing
- Image optimization strategy not defined
- Search implementation method undecided
- Need to handle missing metadata gracefully in collections
- Path prefixing for GitHub Pages may require URL adjustments
