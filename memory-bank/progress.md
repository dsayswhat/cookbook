# Progress Tracking

## Completed
- [x] Technology stack selection
- [x] Basic recipe format design (Markdown with YAML frontmatter)
- [x] Project structure planning
- [x] Memory Bank documentation created
- [x] Eleventy project setup
- [x] Basic configuration in .eleventy.js
- [x] Markdown configuration
- [x] Asset handling setup
- [x] Basic collections setup (recipes, categories, tags)
- [x] Basic template structure (index.njk, recipes.njk, recipe.njk)
- [x] Sample recipe implementation
- [x] Migration script created
- [x] Package.json updated

## In Progress
- [ ] Recipe migration to JSON
- [ ] Basic templates creation
- [ ] Recipe collection implementation
- [ ] Layout system implementation

## To Do
- [ ] Category/tag taxonomy pages
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] PDF generation setup
- [ ] Styling and responsive design
- [ ] Image handling system
- [ ] Recipe variation support
- [ ] Print stylesheets
- [ ] Build optimization
- [ ] Deployment configuration

## Technical Debt
- Need comprehensive recipe format documentation
- Should create recipe validation system
- Consider automated testing for build process
- Need to implement proper error handling for YAML parsing
- Should add documentation for collection usage
- Need to standardize recipe metadata structure

## Known Issues
- PDF generation approach needs testing
- Image optimization strategy not defined
- Search implementation method undecided
- Need to handle missing metadata gracefully in collections
- Layout system needs to be completed
- Route conflict: `/recipes/id` renders frontmatter properly but `/recipe/id` doesn't, yet we prefer the `/recipe/id` URL structure
