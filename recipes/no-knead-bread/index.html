<h1>No-Knead Bread</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Dry Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>6 cups all-purpose or bread flour, more for dusting</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
<li>2 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wet Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>3 1/4 cups warm water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add warm water, and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.</li>
<li>Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.</li>
<li>Heat oven at 450 degrees. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes.</li>
<li>Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Adapted from Jim Lahey, Sullivan Street Bakery. Total time: About 1Â½ hours plus 14 to 20 hours' rising.</p>
