<h1>Basic Pressure-Cooker Risotto</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Main Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cooking spray</li>
<li>1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon butter</li>
<li>1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 cups white or brown Arborio rice</li>
<li>1/2 cup dry white wine, at room temperature</li>
<li>4½ cups vegetable stock, preferably homemade, warmed</li>
<li>1/4 to 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
<li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optional Addition</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 pound ground sausage</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Spray a pressure-cooker pot with cooking spray. Over medium heat, melt the butter and oil together in the cooker. Add the onion and sauté, stirring, until it has softened slightly but is not browned, about 3 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the rice and cook, stirring for about 1 minute, until the grains are shiny and glossed lightly with oil. Raise the heat slightly and stir in the wine. Stir until the wine is mostly absorbed (much less than 1 minute for white rice, and 1½ to 2 minutes for brown).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour in all but ½ cup of the heated stock and turn the heat to high. Lock the lid in place and bring the pressure to high over high heat. Once the pressure is reached, cook for 5 minutes if using white Arborio, or 19 if using brown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When done, release the pressure. Unlock the lid and stir in the remaining broth and the cheese, if using. Season with salt and plenty of pepper and serve at once.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Serves 4 to 6</li>
<li>This is a basic risotto that takes just 5 minutes under pressure with white Arborio rice, and yields a dish with some of the soothing, gentle-but-not-mushy texture of perfect pasta.</li>
<li>Made with brown organic Arborio, it takes 20 minutes, and yields a dish with the classic creamy sauce, with rice kernels that are a bit more assertively flavored and firm.</li>
<li>Almost all classic Italian risotti are enriched at the end with freshly grated Parmesan. For vegans and lactose-intolerant folks, a cheeseless risotto made by this method is still good due to the inherent creaminess of the sauce.</li>
<li>To experience it at perfect creaminess, dish it up within 1 or 2 minutes of its completion.</li>
<li>Leftover risotto can be made into risotto cakes, which can be sautéed in a nonstick skillet with no additional oil.</li>
