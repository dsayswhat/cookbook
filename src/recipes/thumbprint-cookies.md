Classic thumbprint cookies with a tender buttery base, rolled in chopped nuts, and filled with your choice of jam, jelly, or frosting. Perfect for holidays or any special occasion.

## Ingredients

### Cookie Dough
- 1/2 cup soft shortening (or half butter and half margarine)
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 egg yolk
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup sifted all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

### Coating and Filling
- 1 egg white, slightly beaten
- Finely chopped nuts (or corn flakes)
- Fruit preserves, jelly, or colored frosting for filling

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening (or butter/margarine mixture) and brown sugar until light and fluffy.

3. Add the egg yolk and vanilla extract. Mix well.

4. Sift together the flour and salt, then add to the creamed mixture. Mix until well combined.

5. Roll the dough into 1-inch balls.

6. Dip each ball in the slightly beaten egg white.

7. Roll in finely chopped nuts (or corn flakes) to coat.

8. Place cookies 1 inch apart on greased or parchment-lined baking sheets.

9. Press your thumb into the center of each cookie to create an indentation.

10. Bake for 10-15 minutes until set and light golden brown.

11. Remove from oven and immediately re-press the centers if needed (they may have puffed up during baking).

12. Fill each thumbprint with your choice of fruit preserves, jelly, or colored frosting while still warm.

13. Cool on a wire rack.
