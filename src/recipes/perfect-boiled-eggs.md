# Perfect Hard-Boiled Eggs

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients
- 3 quarts water
- 1 to 6 large eggs

### Optional (for serving cold)
- 1 tray of ice cubes

## Instructions

1. If serving eggs cold, add 1 tray of ice cubes to a large bowl and fill with water
2. Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a large pot
3. Carefully lower eggs into pot and continue to boil for 30 seconds
4. Cover tightly, reduce heat to low (water should maintain a bare simmer)
5. Continue cooking for 11 minutes
6. Serve immediately if serving hot
7. If serving cold, immediately place eggs in bowl of ice water and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before peeling under cool running water

### To Peel
1. Gently tap hard-boiled eggs all over to thoroughly crack the shell
2. Remove shell under a thin stream of running water (the water helps get under the shell and lift it off the egg)

## Notes
- Starting the eggs in boiling water reduces how much the white sticks to the shell
- Limiting the batch size to a maximum of 6 eggs per 3 quarts water ensures correct timing
- For an easier, quicker method, see steamed eggs recipe
- Shell-on hard-boiled eggs can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days
- Once the shell is removed, they can be refrigerated for up to 1 day
