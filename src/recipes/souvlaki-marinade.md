# Mediterranean Souvlaki Marinade

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 3 tablespoons minced garlic (from jar)
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1 medium red onion, diced
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 tablespoon pepper
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning

## Instructions

1. Combine olive oil, red wine vinegar, minced garlic, and lemon juice in a bowl
2. Add diced red onion
3. Stir in salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning
4. Mix well until all ingredients are thoroughly combined
5. Pour over chicken or pork
6. Marinate for 2 to 6 hours for best flavor

## Notes
1 batch of this will works with a big pack of boneless chicken breasts (4 lbs, usually 5 chicken breasts).

We also use it with 4-5 pork chops. I usually cut them about 1 inch thick from a pork loin, but you can buy them pre-cut as well.
