## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients
- 6-8 frozen waffles (1/2 inch thick)
- 12 ounces maple breakfast sausage, crumbled
- Unsalted butter (for dish)
- 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
- 6 large eggs
- 1 1/4 cups whole or low-fat milk
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon pepper

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Arrange waffles in single layer on baking sheet. Bake until crisp, about 10 minutes per side.
2. Brown sausage in non-stick skillet over medium heat, breaking it apart with spoon, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain on paper-towel-lined plate.
3. Butter 8-inch square baking dish. Add half of waffles in single layer. Add half of sausage and 1/2 cup cheese. Repeat layering of waffles, sausage, and 1/2 cup cheese. Whisk eggs, milk, maple syrup, salt, and pepper in medium bowl until combined. Pour egg mixture evenly over casserole. Cover baking dish with plastic wrap and place weights on top. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.
4. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Let casserole stand at room temperature for 20 minutes. Uncover casserole and sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup cheese over top. Bake until edges and center are puffed, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool 5 minutes. Cut into pieces and serve.

## Notes
Serves 6. Belgian-style frozen waffles are too thick for this recipe. To double the recipe, use a 13x9-inch baking dish and increase the baking time by 30 to 40 minutes.
