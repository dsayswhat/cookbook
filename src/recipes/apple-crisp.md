## Ingredients

### Filling
- 5 cups sliced, peeled cooking apples
- 2 to 4 tablespoons granulated sugar

### Topping
- 1/2 cup regular rolled oats
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1/4 cup chopped nuts or coconut (optional)
- Vanilla ice cream (optional, for serving)

## Instructions

1. For filling, place peeled and sliced apples in a 2-quart square baking dish. Stir in the granulated sugar.

2. For topping, in a medium bowl combine the oats, brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon. Cut in butter till mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the nuts or coconut if using. Sprinkle topping over filling.

3. Bake crisp in a 375Â° oven for 30 to 35 minutes or till fruit is tender and topping is golden. If desired, serve warm with ice cream.

## Notes

- You can substitute other fruits like pears, peaches, or apricots for the apples if desired.
- Frozen fruit can be used - thaw first but do not drain.
- For frozen fruit, increase baking time to approximately 40 minutes.
- For a spicier version, you can use nutmeg or ginger instead of cinnamon.
