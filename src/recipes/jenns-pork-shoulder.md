## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients
- 4 lb pork shoulder
- 12 oz beer
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil

### Spice Rub
- 3 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp kosher salt
- 1 tbsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 300Â°F
2. Trim excess fat from pork and cut into large pieces to fit in a large Dutch oven
3. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin, then season with black pepper. Rub all over pork. (This can be done the night before.)
4. In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat oil
5. Working in batches, add pork and sear on all sides (Spices can burn quickly so don't let it go for too long!)
6. Pour beer around pork and cover with lid
7. Transfer to oven and cook until pork is beginning to turn tender, about 3 hours
8. Remove lid and cook until pork is very tender and pulls apart easily with a fork, 1 to 2 hours more
9. Remove pork from Dutch oven and let rest before serving

## Notes
This recipe requires a total cooking time of about 5 hours (3 hours with lid + 2 hours without lid).
