## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 1/4 lb baby carrots, sliced diagonally, 1/2 inch thick
- 12 garlic cloves, halved
- Salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1 thyme sprig, leaves minced
- 1 rosemary sprig, leaves minced

## Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a 9 1/2 in nonstick skillet. Add the carrots and garlic and brown for 15 minutes over gentle heat, stirring from time to time.
2. Season with salt and pepper. Add the thyme and rosemary and cook, stirring now and then, for another 15 minutes.
3. Remove the carrots and the garlic to a serving plate. They should not have absorbed the oil, and will be crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.
4. Serve with pan-fried fish, white meats and roasted poultry.

## Notes
- Servings: 3
- Coming from Spain and Sicily via Italy, the carrot spread through Europe in the fourteenth century. In very old recipe books it is known simply as one of the "roots," and not until the eighteenth century was it considered sufficiently "noble" to become an ingredient in the French grande cuisine.
- A popular peasant food (like most root vegetables), the carrot was almost always present in rural dishes. But this humble vegetable can be exquisite when prepared in this way.
