# Momma's Wine Cake

## Ingredients

### Cake Ingredients
- 1 (18.25 ounce) package moist white cake mix
- 1 (5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 3/4 cup vegetable oil
- 3/4 cup white wine (or rum as substitution)
- 4 eggs

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 10 inch bundt pan
2. In medium bowl combine the cake mix, instant vanilla pudding, nutmeg, vegetable oil, white wine (or rum), and eggs. Beat with an electric mixer for 5 minutes
3. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cake cool in pan for 10 minutes then remove cake from pan to rack. Let cake cool completely before slicing
4. Garnish sliced cake with a dollop of whipped cream or dust with confectioners' sugar and sliced strawberries

## Notes
Original recipe from Allrecipes.com, submitted by Esther Nelson. This cake works perfectly for holidays, buffet tables, or picnics. The alcohol bakes off leaving just the flavor. Very moist and has been a family favorite for over 20 years.

For a textured crust, "flour" the greased pan with cocoa powder or a cinnamon sugar mixture. Fill a clean salt shaker for easy application. This eliminates the white residue on the outside of your baked cake.

Note on modern cake mixes: This recipe was originally written for boxed cake mixes that were 18.25 oz. Since boxed cake mixes have gotten smaller in recent years, consider adding 5-6 tablespoons of all-purpose flour to the mix to reach the original volume for best results.
