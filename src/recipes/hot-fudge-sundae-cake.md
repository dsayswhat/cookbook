## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients
- 1 cup flour
- 3/4 cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons cocoa
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

### Wet Ingredients
- 1/2 cup milk
- 2 tablespoons oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla

### Topping
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup cocoa
- 1 3/4 cups boiling water

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Get an ungreased 9x9 inch pan.

2. Mix dry ingredients directly in the pan: flour, white sugar, cocoa, baking powder, and salt.

3. In a separate bowl, mix wet ingredients: milk, oil, and vanilla.

4. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients in the pan. Stir until smooth.

5. Mix brown sugar and cocoa together for the topping. Sprinkle evenly over the batter.

6. Pour 1 3/4 cups boiling water over the entire mixture.

7. Bake for 40 minutes.

## Notes

- This unique cake creates its own fudge sauce while baking - the hot water poured over the top creates a delicious chocolate sauce underneath the cake.
- Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream for a true sundae experience.
- The cake may look unusual with the water on top before baking, but this is correct - don't stir after adding the water.
