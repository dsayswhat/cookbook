Soft and chewy molasses cookies rolled in granulated sugar. These cookies have a wonderful spiced flavor and a sugary crackled top. Recipe from Marie's kitchen.

## Ingredients

### Wet Ingredients
- 3/4 cup shortening
- 1 cup granulated sugar, plus extra for rolling
- 1/4 cup molasses
- 1 egg

### Dry Ingredients
- 2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Melt the shortening in a 3-4 quart saucepan over low heat. Remove from heat and let cool.

2. Add the sugar, egg, and molasses to the cooled shortening. Beat well until combined.

3. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, and salt.

4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and mix until well combined.

5. Refrigerate the dough until chilled (at least 1 hour).

6. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).

7. Form the dough into 1-inch balls.

8. Roll each ball in granulated sugar to coat.

9. Place cookies on greased cookie sheets, spacing them well apart as they will spread.

10. Bake for 8-10 minutes until edges are set but centers are still soft.

11. Let cool on baking sheets for 2-3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

## Time Information

## Notes

- The cookies will look slightly underbaked when you remove them - they'll firm up as they cool
- Don't overbake or they'll be hard instead of chewy
- Rolling in sugar creates the classic crackled appearance
- Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week
