# Easy Pie Dough

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients
- 2 1/2 cups (12.5 ounces; 350 grams) all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons (25 grams) sugar
- 1 teaspoon (5 grams) kosher salt
- 2 1/2 sticks (10 ounces; 280 grams) unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pats
- 6 tablespoons (3 ounces; 85 milliliters) cold water

## Instructions

1. Combine two thirds of flour with sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse twice to incorporate. Spread butter chunks evenly over surface. Pulse until no dry flour remains and dough just begins to collect in clumps, about 25 short pulses. Use a rubber spatula to spread the dough evenly around the bowl of the food processor. Sprinkle with remaining flour and pulse until dough is just barely broken up, about 5 short pulses. Transfer dough to a large bowl.
2. Sprinkle with water then using a rubber spatula, fold and press dough until it comes together into a ball. Divide ball in half. Form each half into a 4-inch disk. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before rolling and baking.

## Special Equipment
- Food processor

## Notes
- Makes 2 single crust or 1 double crusted pie
- This beginner-friendly recipe is extra easy to roll out, and it bakes up tender, crisp, and lightly flaky
- You can make it ahead of timeâ€”just wrap the dough tightly in plastic, place it in a zipper lock bag with as much air pressed out as possible, and freeze it for up to three months, letting it thaw in the refrigerator before rolling and baking
- Total time: 10 minutes
- Active time: 10 minutes

## Why It Works
- All-butter gives this pie crust extra flavor
- Combining the flour and butter in two distinct phases creates a dough that is tender and flaky yet extremely easy to roll out
