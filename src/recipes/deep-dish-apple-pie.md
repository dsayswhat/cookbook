## Why This Recipe Works

The problem with deep-dish apple pie is that the apples are often unevenly cooked (some mushy, some crunchy) and the exuded juice leaves the apples swimming in an ocean of liquid, producing a bottom crust that is a pale, soggy mess. Then there is the gaping hole left between the apples (which are shrunken from the loss of all that moisture) and the arching top crust, making it impossible to slice and serve a neat piece of pie. We wanted our piece of deep-dish pie to be a towering wedge of tender, juicy apples, fully framed by a buttery, flaky crust.

Precooking the apples solved the shrinking problem, helped the apples hold their shape, and prevented a flood of juices from collecting in the bottom of the pie plate, giving us a nicely browned bottom crust. Why didn't cooking the apples twice (once on the stovetop and once in the oven) cause them to become insipid and mushy? We learned that when the apples are gently heated, their pectin is converted to a heat-stable form that keeps them from becoming mushy when cooked further in the oven. All that was left to do was to choose the right combination of sweet and tart apples and stir in a little brown sugar, salt, lemon, and cinnamon, for flavor and sweetness.

## Ingredients

### Crust
- 1 recipe double-crust pie dough (All-Butter Double-Crust Pie Dough, Basic Double-Crust Pie Dough, or Foolproof Double-Crust Pie Dough recommended)
- Unbleached all-purpose flour, for the work surface

### Filling
- 2 1/2 pounds firm tart apples (about 5 large), peeled, cored, and sliced 1/4 inch thick
- 2 1/2 pounds firm sweet apples (about 5 large), peeled, cored, and sliced 1/4 inch thick
- 1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup packed (1 3/4 ounces) light brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon grated zest plus 1 tablespoon juice from 1 lemon
- 1/4 teaspoon table salt
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 large egg white, lightly beaten

## Instructions

1. Following the photos, roll one disk of dough into a 12-inch circle on a lightly floured work surface, then fit it into a 9-inch pie plate, letting the excess dough hang over the edge; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Roll the other disk of dough into a 12-inch circle on a lightly floured work surface, then transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

2. Toss the apples, 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar, the brown sugar, zest, salt, and cinnamon together in a Dutch oven. Cover and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the apples are tender when poked with a fork but still hold their shape, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the apples and their juice to a rimmed baking sheet and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

3. Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position, place a rimmed baking sheet on the rack, and heat the oven to 425 degrees. Drain the cooled apples thoroughly through a colander, reserving 1/4 cup of the juice. Stir the lemon juice into the reserved 1/4 cup apple juice.

4. Spread the apples into the dough-lined pie plate, mounding them slightly in the middle, and drizzle with the lemon juice mixture. Following the photos, loosely roll the second piece of dough around the rolling pin and gently unroll it over the pie. Trim, fold, and crimp the edges and cut four vent holes in the top. Brush the dough with the egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.

5. Place the pie on the heated baking sheet and bake until the crust is golden, about 25 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees, rotate the baking sheet, and continue to bake until the juices are bubbling and the crust is deep golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes longer. Cool the pie on a wire rack until the filling has set, about 2 hours; serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

## Notes

- **Serves 8**
- Use a combination of tart and sweet apples for this pie. Good choices for tart are Granny Smiths, Empires, or Cortlands; for sweet we recommend Golden Delicious, Jonagolds, or Braeburns.
- Serve with vanilla ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream.
- The recipe references photos for rolling and assembling the pie dough (see original source).
