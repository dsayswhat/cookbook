## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients
- 6 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon sour cream
- 1/2 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon spicy brown mustard (such as Gulden's)
- 1/4 teaspoon sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon pepper

## Instructions

1. Place eggs in medium saucepan, cover with 1 inch of water, and bring to boil over high heat. Remove pan from heat, cover, and let stand 10 minutes. Meanwhile, fill medium bowl with 1 quart water and 1 dozen ice cubes. Pour off water from saucepan and gently shake pan back and forth to crack shells. Transfer eggs to ice water with slotted spoon and let cool 5 minutes.

2. Peel eggs and slice in half lengthwise. Transfer yolks to fine-mesh sieve and use spatula to press them through sieve and into bowl. Add remaining ingredients, mashing mixture against sides of bowl until smooth.

3. Arrange whites on serving platter and fill with yolk mixture, mounding filling about 1/2 inch above whites. Serve immediately.

## Notes
- Makes 1 dozen filled halves
- To center the yolks, turn the carton of eggs on its side in the refrigerator the day before you plan to cook the eggs (see page 30 for details).
- You can make the deviled eggs up to 2 days ahead. Wrap the peeled egg-white halves tightly in plastic wrap and store the filling in a separate container.
- The cooking method described (bringing water to boil, removing from heat, covering for 10 minutes) results in perfectly cooked eggs without overcooking or creating a green ring around the yolks.
