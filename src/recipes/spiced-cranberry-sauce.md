# Spiced Cranberry Sauce

## Ingredients

### Spices
- 10 whole allspice berries
- 10 whole cloves
- 10 whole black peppercorns
- 1 small cinnamon stick

### Main Ingredients
- 4 cups fresh or thawed frozen cranberries
- 1½ cups Oregon pinot noir
- 1 cup light brown sugar, loosely packed
- 1 cup clover or wildflower honey
- 1 cup fresh orange juice
- 6 strips orange zest, about 1 inch by 3 inches, removed with a vegetable peeler
- 2 (4-inch) sprigs rosemary
- 1 vanilla pod

## Instructions

1. Combine allspice, cloves and peppercorns in a spice grinder or coffee grinder and pulse until finely ground
2. In a medium saucepan, combine cranberries, wine, brown sugar, honey, orange juice, orange zest, rosemary, cinnamon stick and ground spices
3. With the tip of a paring knife, split vanilla pod lengthwise. Use the back of the knife to scrape seeds from pod. Add seeds and pod to pot
