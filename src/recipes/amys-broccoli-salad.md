A classic broccoli salad with a sweet and tangy dressing, featuring crispy bacon.

## Ingredients

### For the Dressing
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 4 tablespoons white wine vinegar

### For the Salad
- 4 heads broccoli, cut into bite-sized florets
- 1/4 purple onion, finely diced
- 9 pieces bacon, cooked crispy and crumbled

## Instructions

1. Cook bacon until crispy, then crumble and set aside
2. Cut broccoli into bite-sized florets, discarding tough stems
3. Finely dice the purple onion

### Make the Dressing
4. In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, sugar, and white wine vinegar until sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth

### Assemble the Salad
5. In a large bowl, combine broccoli florets, diced onion, and crumbled bacon
6. Pour dressing over the broccoli mixture and toss until everything is well coated
7. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving to allow flavors to meld

## Notes

- Salad can be made up to 24 hours in advance
- Store covered in the refrigerator
- The longer it sits, the softer the broccoli becomes - add just before serving if you prefer crunchier broccoli
