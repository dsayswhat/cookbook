## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients
- 4 large egg yolks
- 2/3 cup (134g) granulated sugar
- 1 Tablespoon lemon zest (about 1 lemon)
- 1/3 cup (80ml) fresh lemon juice (about 2-3 lemons)
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 6 Tablespoons (86g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature

## Instructions

1. Fill the bottom pot of your double boiler with 1-2 inches of water. (Or use the DIY double boiler method listed in the notes.) Place on high heat. Once the water begins to boil, reduce to low heat to keep the water at a simmer
2. Place egg yolks, granulated sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt into the top pot of your double boiler. Using a silicone whisk, whisk until completely blended, then continue to whisk as the curd cooks. Constant whisking prevents the egg yolks from curdling. Whisk and cook until the mixture becomes thick, resembling the texture of hollandaise sauce, about 10 minutes. If curd isn't thickening, turn up the heat and constantly whisk
3. Remove pan from heat. Cut the butter into 6 separate pieces, then whisk into the curd. The butter will melt from the heat of the curd. Pour curd into a jar or bowl and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top so it is touching the top of the curd. (This prevents a skin from forming on top.) The curd will continue to thicken as it cools. Once cool, the plastic wrap can be removed
4. Refrigerate the curd for up to about 10 days

## Notes
- **Freezing Instructions:** For longer storage, you can freeze the curd up to 3-6 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before enjoying
- **Thicker Lemon Curd:** For thicker lemon curd, replace 2 of the egg yolks with 1 whole egg. This means you will use 2 egg yolks plus 1 whole egg. Keep the rest of the recipe and instructions the same
- **DIY Double Boiler Method:** If you don't have a double boiler, you can create one by placing a heat-proof bowl over a pot of simmering water. Make sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water
- You only need 5 simple ingredients for homemade lemon curd, and the recipe comes together on the stove in 10 minutes!
