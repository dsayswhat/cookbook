## Ingredients

### Pasta and Sauce
- 1 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta
- 1 (32-ounce) jar spaghetti sauce

### Cheese Mixture
- 24 ounces ricotta cheese
- 1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 large egg, beaten

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish
2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and rinse
3. Combine cooked ziti, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, egg, and 1 1/2 cups spaghetti sauce in a medium bowl
4. Transfer into the prepared baking dish. Top with remaining spaghetti sauce, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; let stand for 15 minutes before serving

## Notes
This easy baked ziti with ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan is so good! Three cheeses layered with pasta and marinara sauce.

Handwritten notes from Jenn: "Cheesy!!" with suggestions to "try 12 oz ricotta" instead of 24 ounces and "1/2 lb mozz" instead of 1 pound of mozzarella.
