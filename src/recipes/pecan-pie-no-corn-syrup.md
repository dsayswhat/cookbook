# Pecan Pie (No Corn Syrup)

## Ingredients

### Crust
- 1 unbaked 9" pie shell

### Filling
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 2 eggs
- 2 tablespoon milk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 1/2 cup butter, melted
- 1/4 teaspoon salt (1/2 teaspoon if using unsalted butter)
- 1 cup chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F
2. In a large mixing bowl, mix sugars and flour. Add remaining ingredients, beating very well. (A pie not mixed well enough may end up with a layer of sugar at the bottom of the filling â€“ check the filling by rubbing a bit between your fingers to make sure the sugars have dissolved.)
3. Pour mixture into prepared 9" pie shell. Sprinkle nuts evenly on top. Bake until crust is golden and pie filling puffy but still slightly wobbly in center, about 40-45 minutes. The filling will settle down and solidify as it cools. Cool completely, at least four hours.

## Notes
- Jenny uses less (around 2/3 cup) pecans in her excellent pies. Use more or less, depending on your taste.
- Add a tablespoon of brandy, rum or bourbon for a more spirited pie.
- Pecan pie keeps well at room temperature for several days.
