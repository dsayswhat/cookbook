A delicious cookie made with graham cracker crumbs that creates a wonderful texture and flavor. Perfect for enjoying on their own or with a glass of milk.

## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients
- 1 ¼ cup (125g) graham cracker crumbs
- 1 cup (142g) all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt

### Wet Ingredients
- 9 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
- ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line two or three baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the graham cracker crumbs, flour, baking powder, and salt.

3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter for one minute until creamy. Add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and mix until combined, scraping down the sides as needed.

4. Add the graham cracker mixture and mix until combined.

5. Scoop the dough into 1 oz balls (about 2 tablespoons each) and place on prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
