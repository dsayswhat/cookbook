# Bear Spaghetti

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients
- 1 lb spaghetti
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, sliced thin
- 1 cup fresh basil leaves, packed
- 1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 medium onion, halved and peeled
- 1 (28 oz) can San Marzano tomatoes
- Salt to taste
- Fresh parmesan cheese, grated (for garnish)
- Additional fresh basil (for garnish)
- Black pepper (optional)

## Instructions

1. Make the basil oil: Add olive oil to a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add garlic, hot pepper flakes, and fresh basil (pack it in). Cook for 45 seconds to 2 minutes until basil starts to wilt and garlic is fragrant. Remove from heat and let flavors mellow.

2. In a Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat. Place onion halves cut-side down in the butter. Cook for 3-4 minutes until just starting to brown, watching carefully not to burn the butter.

3. Add San Marzano tomatoes to the Dutch oven, crushing them roughly with a potato masher if using whole tomatoes. Add salt to taste, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook for 20 minutes.

4. Meanwhile, transfer the cooled basil oil to a food processor and blend until chopped.

5. Start cooking spaghetti in salted boiling water according to package directions until just under al dente.

6. Add the blended basil oil to the tomatoes and cook for 5 more minutes. Remove the onion halves.

7. Add the slightly undercooked spaghetti to the sauce and cook for another minute to finish cooking the pasta in the sauce.

8. Serve immediately topped with fresh parmesan cheese, additional basil, and a crack of black pepper if desired.

## Notes
The key is not to overcook the basil - you want to preserve its fresh flavor. The pasta finishes cooking in the sauce for better flavor absorption. Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 3 days and reheat gently with a little water for moisture.
